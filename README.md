# GPT-Enabled Android Application

This Android application uses the GPT API to generate natural language text based on user input. The application is written in Kotlin and can be easily customized and extended to meet your specific needs.
Requirements

    Android Studio 4.1 or higher
    Android SDK 30 or higher
    GPT API key

## Getting Started

To use this application, you will need to obtain an API key for the GPT service. You can obtain a key by following the instructions on the GPT API documentation website.

Once you have obtained your API key, you can insert it into the gradle.properties file located in the project's root directory.

The file should contain the following line:

makefile

GPT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

After you have set up your API key, you can open the project in Android Studio and run the application on an emulator or a physical device.
Usage

When you launch the application, you will be presented with a simple user interface that allows you to enter a prompt for the GPT API to generate text from. Simply type your prompt into the text field and click the "Generate" button to generate a text response.

The generated text will be displayed in a separate text field below the prompt input field. You can generate new responses by entering new prompts and clicking the "Generate" button again.
Customization

This application is fully customizable and can be extended to meet your specific needs. You can modify the user interface, add new features, and integrate the GPT API with other services or data sources.

To get started with customizing the application, you can explore the code in the src directory. The main logic for the GPT API integration is contained in the MainActivity.kt file.
